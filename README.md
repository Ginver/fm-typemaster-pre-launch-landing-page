# Challenging myself with:
# Frontend Mentor - Typemaster pre-launch landing page

This premium challenge is a perfect portfolio piece.

**To do this challenge, I needed a good understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Personal challenge

My biggest challenge was during this project is to create the responsive design for diverse screensizes. 
It was amazing to practice to flexbox all the small items which overflow the screen.

Great experience!
